  "about": [
    "I began my software engineering journey in 2017, working on full-stack applications using MEAN stack and mobile development with IONIC. This early experience provided me a solid foundation across different platforms.",
    "At Cramstack, I progressed from Software Engineer to Lead Software Engineer, where I specialized in Natural Language Query (NLQ) systems. I built data visualization components, optimized query processing, and eventually led teams developing secure document management systems for banking clients.",
    "My career advanced when I joined MedEase Technology as Senior Software Engineer, where I developed HIPAA-compliant healthcare solutions. I designed high-performance microservices, integrated banking APIs, and significantly improved infrastructure efficiency, reducing SSL configuration time by 80%.",
    "Currently at Pinwheel, I'm building scalable applications with React, React Native, and Node.js. I've implemented WebAuthn authentication, developed real-time device update systems using MQTT, and created comprehensive testing frameworks to ensure product reliability.",
    "Throughout my career, I've specialized in TypeScript, React, Node.js (NestJS), GraphQL, and cloud infrastructure with AWS and Docker. I've consistently delivered efficient solutions for complex problems, from document processing pipelines handling 100K+ documents to optimizing CI/CD workflows that reduced deployment times by 50%.",
    "With my M.Sc. in Computer Science focused on distributed systems, I continuously explore new technologies while applying best practices in architecture, security, and performance optimization across all my projects."
